R.Tarjan algorithm is a graph algorithm for find articulation point in graphs.

An articulation point is such a point in graph that once removed this point in the graph, graph would be divided into two connected components.

For example, assume there is a graph `A--B--C`. `B` is a articulation point since the graph would be divided in to connected components `A` and `C` if `B` is removed.
