# Problem 319 - Bulb Switcher
The origin of this problem is a math problem and you should find the rule in this problem.<br/>
My solution is the TLE solution. I learnt the awesome solution from internet.<br/>
The general idea of the awesome solution is finding the number of complete square number in _n_.<br/>
Try to calculate [1..36] bulbs switchers and you will find it.<br/>
However, I can't find this rule.
