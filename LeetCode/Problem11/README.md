# Problem 11 - Container With Most Water
My TLE-Solution is a brutally search algorithm. The AC solution I learnt is based on this fact:<br/>
If the left's height is lower than right's, search the next left's height to form new area because they may form a larger area.<br/>
Or search the next right's height.
