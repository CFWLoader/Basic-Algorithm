# Problem 234 - Palindrome Linked List
The advanced challenge is implementing your algorithm with O(1) space complexity.<br/>
My S(1) algorithm is converting the iterative algorithm (stack) to recursive algorithm.<br/>
The recursive one transfers to memory overhead to function call stack though it seemingly cuts the extra space in the function.<br/>
So I solve this problem with a trivial S(n) = O(n) algorithm.
