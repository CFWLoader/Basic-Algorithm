# Problem 334 - Increasing Triplet Subsequence
I can't solve the problem by myself so I copy the solution from internet.
The core of this solution is set double check(set two variables to record the two minimum element in the array).
If the algorithm can't find such number, it means there is a number larger than this two variables and find the subsequence.
