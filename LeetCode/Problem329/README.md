# Problem 329 - Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
I have tried to solve this problem via Ruby but failed.<br/>
It seems like Ruby has a unknown language trait for me and I can't learn it.<br/>
I will try to solve this problem with other language or fix the bugs in Ruby language.

## Fix log
The same column in the matrix will be signed same value when some of them being reassigned new value.
